jquery-localmodel
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simock85/jquery-localmodel.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simock85/jquery-localmodel)

jquery-localmodel simplifies asynchronous communication and dom manipulation in your *old but solid gold* server-side
web application.

It handles the dirty work of storing data on the client side, and keeping that data in sync with your server and
the UI.
